# Current status

The editor is under implementation. Full feature parity is **not complete**.
The reference is Extractor Reborn v1.23, commit
`8ed6b90c8907e36dae2a33316294051a0a67db9c`; unfinished upstream research is
distinguished from released functionality in the parity tracker.

Implemented: installed-assets indexing, standard and paired resource discovery,
Xbox DDS previews/replacement, textured scene preview with instance transforms,
Xbox roster names/basic fields/palettes/uniform routing, 21 native player
properties, 30 named ratings, undo/redo, and XMA2 WAV export/native PCM imports.
Licensed music and band/fight songs have separate Audio views. All 87 jukebox
title/index/category mappings were recovered from Xbox native tables and matched
to Xbox localization IDs. Band-bank clips retain their original numeric labels.

Roster CSV comparison supports field selection and transactional, undoable
application. Ratings can be copied to multiple selected players. New uniform
world/selection folders passed a private-copy test: 989 rows after expansion,
five independent texture bindings, unchanged source templates, successful reopen.
Full runtime integration validation remains. Native PCM SDK integration builds;
loop/seek behavior and runtime acceptance remain incomplete. The installed game
has not been launched or modified for testing this editor.

Do not treat offline preview or structural tests as gameplay confirmation.
